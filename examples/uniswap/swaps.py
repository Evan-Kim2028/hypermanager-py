    Queries events from multiple blockchain clients for the Across Protocol.

    The function iterates through each client configured in the `client_config` dictionary,
    which contains HyperSync client instances and their corresponding SpokePool contract addresses.
    For each client, the function loops through the event configurations (e.g., event signatures and column mappings)
    and attempts to retrieve logs using the `HyperManager` interface.

    Each set of events, if found, is stored as a Parquet file in a `data/` directory,
    grouped by client name and event type.

    Note:
        The function skips events if they are not found or if errors occur during querying.
