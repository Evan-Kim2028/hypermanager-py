"""
Example of Multi-chain Event Query for Across Protocol

This script demonstrates how to query events from the Across Protocol using the HyperManager framework.
Across is a bridge protocol that allows users to transfer assets between different chains. This example
shows how to programmatically interact with HyperManager protocols, schemas, and event configurations to
efficiently query events from different blockchain clients.

The events queried in this example are dynamically pulled from different chains, and the results are saved
as Parquet files to the 'data' folder. If no events are found for a particular configuration or chain, the
script skips that event.

How to run:
Run the script via:
    python examples/across/spoke_pool_v3.py

    Queries events from multiple blockchain clients for the Across Protocol.

    The function iterates through each client configured in the `client_config` dictionary,
    which contains HyperSync client instances and their corresponding SpokePool contract addresses.
    For each client, the function loops through the event configurations (e.g., event signatures and column mappings)
    and attempts to retrieve logs using the `HyperManager` interface.

    Each set of events, if found, is stored as a Parquet file in a `data/` directory,
    grouped by client name and event type.

    Note:
        The function skips events if they are not found or if errors occur during querying.
